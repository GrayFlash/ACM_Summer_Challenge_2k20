You are given a parabola  x2 = 4*a*y


 

Just Find if given point P(X,Y) lies on this parabola or not
NOTE : Points are in Double(Decimal Numbers) and there will be atmost 3 digits after decimal point like 2.345 , 0.001 , 2345.432.

 

Input

The first line contains an integer T  --- the number of test cases in the input. Then T test cases follow.

Each test case is a line containing X,Y,a  denoting point P(X,Y), and a as in problem statement.
 

Output

Print T answers to the test cases.
Each answer must be "YES" or "NO" depending on if point lies on parabola or not;

Constraints

1 <= t <= 105

0 ≤ X,Y,a ≤ 100
